This is a Flutter based project.
The SmartMedGrow project empowers users with extensive knowledge about

medicinal plants, offering features like Medicinal Plant Identification for 29 plant

classes through image capture or upload, and detailed information on each plantâ€™s

uses, side and safety warnings. It supports Malayalam for broader accessibility and

includes a Community Forum for knowledge sharing and expert advice. Users can

explore plants by categories like skincare and diet through the Plant Repository,

receive plant care tips, and find natural remedies for common ailments in the

Common Diseases Home Remedies section.
